CS4093 Constraints Programming - Report
Jonathan O'Mahony 113763679

******************************
To implement this problem, I decided to use the Task object, alongside the cumulative scheduler built into Choco.
To do this, I created several Choco variables:
    - makespan: To read the maximum length of time the meetings scheduled together would take.
    - heights: To analyse the consumption for each meeting (for this problem, each was set to 1)
    - startOfMeetings: The start of each meeting, that I then used for input for the various search strategies.
    - capacity: The maximum number of meetings that could be scheduled at any one time (the number of projectors)
    - meetings: The actual array of meetings Task objects.

I then iterated through each meeting to assign start and end times.
To get the start time of each meeting, I used a second inner for loop to iterate through the earliest start time for
each team member. Using a variable called startingPoint, initially set to 0, I checked the earliestStart array for any
team members that had specifications on the day they could start, setting the startingPoint to this value if so.
I then initialised each meeting Task object using this startingPoint variable, and the durations array, which together
assigned the end day.
I then set the heights array for each meeting to 1.
I found the start of each meeting, assigning it to startOfMeetings.
I then set a constraint on each array that each meeting ends before the makespan.

From here, I set a cumulative scheduler using the meetings, heights and capacity variables, that at this point, have
all been correctly initialised and set.

The next task to tackle was finding a method of ensuring there was no overlap between meetings that had the same participants.
To do this, I used an altered version of the triple for loop as demonstrated in the lecture, where I iterate through
each meeting and person attending the meetings. If a person is attending a meeting, I iterate through the rest of the
meetings, and ensure that there is no overlap between meetings, if that current person is to attend both. This is done
through the use of the model.or() method.

After this I implemented each of the search strategies in turn to assess which was the most successful.

I also posted the constraint to minimise the makespan.

In the end the results of each search were as follows for meetings3.txt:
Default Search:
    - No. Solutions: 4
    - Fewest number of days needed: 15
    - Backtracks: 147
    - Resolution time: 0.070s
DomOverWDegSeach:
    - No. Solutions: 4
    - Fewest number of days needed: 15
    - Backtracks: 149
    - Resolution time: 0.071s
InputOrderLBSearch:
    - No. Solutions: 4
    - Fewest number of days needed: 15
    - Backtracks: 773
    - Resolution time: 0.196s
ActivityBasedSearch:
    - No. Solutions: 5
    - Fewest number of days needed: 5
    - Backtracks: 82
    - Resolution time: 0.334s
ImpactBasedSearch:
    - No. Solutions: 6
    - Fewest number of days needed: 15
    - Backtracks: 429
    - Resolution time: 0.089s

From looking at this, it is clear that while ImpactBasedSearch has one of the higher backtracks count, it also provides
more solutions, if you are looking for a number of legitimate alternatives.
However, each search found the shortest makespan to be 15. And the seach that did this in the quickest time was
the Default Search or DomOverWDegSearch.


While attempting to tackle this problem, I investigated a number of methods to solve it.
    - My initial thought was to represent the meetings and people in meetings as a matrix, and ensuring that no meetings
        would be allowed to happen if there were more meetings happening in one day than there were projectors available.
    - This solution worked with the assumption that the projectors were themselves the resources, rather than the capacity.
    - Upon realising that in fact, the people assigned to meetings were the resources for the meetings, I changed my model.
    - I initially hoped to use reification to constrain the meetings, people and projectors together. However, I struggled
        with this model and how to make it work with the cumulative scheduler.
        This was the reason for implementing in the way that I did.
